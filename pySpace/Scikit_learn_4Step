scikit-learn 4 Step modeling Pattern:

1. Import the Class you plan to Use.
2. "Instantiate" the estimator
	"Estimator" is scikit-learn's term for model
	"Instantiate" means " make an instace of"
	
	Name of the objet does not matter
	can specify tuning parameters (aka "hyperparameters" during this Step)
	All parametes not specified are set to their defaults

3. fit the model with the data(aka "model trainning")
	Model is lrearning the realationship between X and y
	Occures in place

4. Predict the responce for a new observation
	New observation are called "out-of-sample" data
	Uses the information it learned during the model training process
	
	Return a NumPy array
	Van pridict for a multiple observations at once
